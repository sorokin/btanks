*) a lotta of various bugfixes everywhere (mostly multiplayer, several crashes)
*) interpolation support in multiplayer. 
*) preliminary and experimental weather support 
*) added proper player placement into checkpoint.
*) added `teleport' object which easily could be extended with `telefrag' support.
*) added new major feature : isolated z-boxes (different worlds, checkpoints, hints and spawns in one map)
*) show/hide mouse pointer if needed
*) reduces respawn intervals for machinegunner/thrower items.
*) added several commands to console : setz, position
*) introduced default impassability for a map. 
*) timestamps in logs

0.4.2623: 

*) added game statistics shown by 'TAB' key.
*) reworked all UI: menus, player/map pickers with usual controls. map descriptions. added mouse handling everywhere.
*) you can assign experimental AI units to players right from menu. 
*) fixed long standing bug with bullets sticking to each other. 
*) animated tiles support (map), animated water tileset. (added an all maps where possible ;)
*) map can provide hints, useful for tutorial or in-game messages. 
*) zombie unit added :)
*) new tune (gameboy)
*) preliminary internationalization support.
*) fonts now scanned to properly calculate letters' widths.
*) synchronize map damage between server/clients.
*) minimap could be now switched on and off with 'M' key. (also minimap shows important targets)
*) removed useless SDL subsystems from initialization (audio, cdrom)
*) caching 'fadeout' surfaces to improve fadeout feature performance.
*) cleaned code from direct loadImage() calls, do all stuff via ResourceManager.

0.3.2234: 

*) bugfixes... bugfixes... bugfixes...
*) a pair of brand new map
*) new objects: 
	*) empty vehicles which could be driven (cars, tanks, ..)
	*) tents/barracks with troopers
	*) watchtowers with machinegunners and throwers
	*) patrol boat with missiles.
	*) real old-school 'boss' - spaceport Baykonur
*) new multiplayer features (cooperative mode, vehicle selection by server), the most of glitches fixed. AI and pathfinding are now disabled for client side.
*) improved AI for troopers.
*) added gameOver OSD messages and messages generated by objects (spaceport) 
*) guided missiles make simple correction for target velocity
*) calculate map projection with greater precision, more accurate hud. 
*) a lot of pathfinding fixes... added synchronous A* implementation. improved performance of both A* algos.
*) improved collision performance / restored collision caching.
*) implemented first working AI(still experimental and available only by hack ;).
*) almost fixed sound glitches at the end of background tune.
*) game console with spawn/spawnplayer/set/kill and quit command (yeah! we are REAL game now!)
*) improved performance of getNearest() call.
*) more accurate fps limiter/tick calculations (posix clock/windows perf counters)
*) added grid indexes to collide objects on large maps. removed complexity of O(n^2) from everywhere.
*) checkpoints support. 

0.3.1796:

*) updated README's
*) fixed smoke cloud z-positioning.
*) added win32 icon and MSI installer :)

0.3.1774: 

*) spawn explosion on map destruction
*) great performance boost (brand new, rewritten from scratch collision code, fixes in map collision handling)
*) pathfinding and outlines fixes
*) more tiles for damaged map. destructable fences. :)
*) tilesets optimizations
*) cars collides with each other (while troops still do not kill each other)
*) removed various 'grouped' object bugs (slight missiles-on-vehicle delay)
*) added outline for machinegunner player

0.3.1651: 

*) map troops do not kill each other
*) added new 'wastes' map.

0.3.1591: 

*) player can now leave vehicle and act as machinegunner. 
*) now it's possible to destroy/damage map. have fun :). 
*) mine now triggered by object with mass >= 20.
*) fixed in getNearest() - core Object function. various bugs got fixed by that.
*) added invulnerability effect. invulnerability on respawn.
*) added throwers item/throwers for shilka.
*) limited kamikazes dropped by heli.
*) implemented hybrid waypoints-pathfinding system for ai traffic. more pathfinding fixes.
*) moved new object-level pathfinding code to base object.
*) [win32] critical errors appears in messagebox before exit.

0.3.1466: 

*) various small bugfixes.
