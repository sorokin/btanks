	How To Use The glSDL Wrapper Hack
	---------------------------------
	1. Include glSDL.h instead of SDL.h.
	2. Add SDL_GLSDL to the flags to SDL_SetVideoMode().
	3. Do *NOT* use the glSDL_*() calls explicitly!
	4. #define HAVE_OPENGL if OpenGL is present.
	5. Link with SDL, SDL_image, OpenGL and math.
	6. Enjoy!


	Notes
	-----
	* MS Visual C++ users: check out VisualC.html.
	  (Project files by Florian Hufsky. Thanks!)

	* Step 4 is intended to be handled by autoconf
	  scripts or similar, so projects can be compiled
	  with or without OpenGL. If HAVE_OPENGL is not
	  defined when compiling, the application will use
	  SDL directly, as if glSDL was not there.

	  If you're not using GNU autotools or similar
	  configuration tool, you can uncomment the
	  '#define HAVE_OPENGL' line in glSDL.h.

	* No, look again! :-) The parallax4 demo is
	  actually running 640x480 - glSDL 0.2 and later
	  won't even try any lower resolutions.

	* There are some glSDL_*() calls that do not
	  replace SDL API calls. These are the only calls
	  meant to be used explicitly, but as most of them
	  are probably broken, and because they make your
	  code depend on glSDL, it's probably a better
	  idea to just forget about them.

	* Don't whine about the wrapper approach. A real
	  SDL backend version is in the works. (Mostly
	  working as I write this.) This backend lets
	  you run most existing SDL applications with
	  acceleration without recompiling them.
